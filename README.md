# Making a RPG video game

The purpose of the project is to make a simple RPG game that shows off my knowledge of python.

By the middle of june I want to have completed the game with a map and NPC's and enemies with a boss fight at the end of the story.

The tecnology I am using to make this game is pygame and VScode on python.
